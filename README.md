## Hi there 👋

I am **Ilian Zapryanov** graduated as **Python Junior Full-Stack Developer**. I am a programming enthusiast learning about the language of the future world. Currently in love with Python, but not ignoring the other technologies and languages. Not the lone wolf type of developer, I enjoy working in a team because of the new things I am learning about and the new knowledge I am gaining. 

**Programming is about thinking and researching not about remembering.**
